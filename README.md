## How to use:
To add a new task, simply use the designated input field and click the "Add new task" button. Your task will instantly appear in the list, neatly displayed in a visually pleasing format. Each task is accompanied by a checkbox on the left side, which you can use to mark a task as finished. When a task is completed, it is visually distinguished with a line-through style and a tick icon, providing a satisfying sense of accomplishment.

Should you decide to remove a task, a convenient "Remove" button is available next to each task. Clicking this button removes the task from the list, keeping your workspace clutter-free and organized.
